<h1>Hello, World</h1>
<p>Welcome to Foundry — my little corner of the internet for projects, photography, and whatever else I feel like writing about.</p>
<h2>Why I built this</h2>
<p>I wanted somewhere to document things properly. GitHub repos are great for code, but they're a terrible place to explain <em>why</em> you made certain decisions, what you learned along the way, or just share something interesting you noticed while out with a camera.</p>
<p>This site is hand-built — no frameworks, no CMSs, just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript pulling things from GitHub. It felt right to keep it that way. Simple stacks are easier to reason about, and honestly more satisfying to work on.</p>
<h2>What I'll write about</h2>
<p>Expect a mix of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming</strong> — Lua, Python, backend stuff, small experiments</li>
  <li><strong>Photography</strong> — gear thoughts, processing notes, maybe a few bird photos</li>
  <li><strong>Project deep-dives</strong> — the interesting decisions behind whatever I'm building</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not committing to a schedule. Posts will appear when there's something worth saying.</p>
<p>If you want to see what I'm working on right now, check out the <a href="/projects/index.html">Projects</a> page — it pulls the latest commits live from GitHub.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
