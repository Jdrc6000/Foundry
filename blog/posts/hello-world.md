# Hello, World

Welcome to Foundry — my little corner of the internet for projects, photography, and whatever else I feel like writing about.

## Why I built this

I wanted somewhere to document things properly. GitHub repos are great for code, but they're a terrible place to explain *why* you made certain decisions, what you learned along the way, or just share something interesting you noticed while out with a camera.

This site is hand-built — no frameworks, no CMSs, just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript pulling things from GitHub. It felt right to keep it that way. Simple stacks are easier to reason about, and honestly more satisfying to work on.

## What I'll write about

Expect a mix of:

- **Programming** — Lua, Python, backend stuff, small experiments
- **Photography** — gear thoughts, processing notes, maybe a few bird photos
- **Project deep-dives** — the interesting decisions behind whatever I'm building

I'm not committing to a schedule. Posts will appear when there's something worth saying.

If you want to see what I'm working on right now, check out the [Projects](/projects/index.html) page — it pulls the latest commits live from GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by.
